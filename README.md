## 🏙️ About the Project

This project was created as part of the **Scrimba Frontend Career Path**.  
It’s a **Chrome Extension** that allows users to **save and manage website leads (URLs)** directly from the browser.

Once installed, users can:
- Save the **current browser tab URL** with one click  
- **Manually input** a new lead  
- Store and **persist leads using `localStorage`**  
- Clear all saved leads easily  

The extension’s design is minimalist, inspired by the course’s Figma layout, and aims to provide a simple way to collect and manage useful links for study or work.

## 💡 What I Learned

From this project, I solidified my understanding of key **JavaScript DOM and browser APIs**, including:

* `addEventListener()` for handling button clicks  
* Accessing and modifying element values with **`input.value`**  
* Updating HTML dynamically with **`innerHTML`**  
* Writing functions that accept **parameters** for reusability  
* Using **template strings** for cleaner and more readable code  
* Saving and retrieving data from **`localStorage`**  
* Converting and storing data structures using the **JSON object**  
* Managing **arrays of objects** to represent multiple leads  

> This project helped me connect the dots between JavaScript fundamentals and real browser APIs, especially how data can persist between sessions.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted to create something practical that connects **JavaScript learning** with **real browser functionality**.  
Building a Chrome extension gave me a deeper understanding of how **JavaScript interacts with the browser environment** — beyond the simple `index.html` page setup.

It also pushed me to explore how data is stored locally and retrieved using `localStorage` and JSON, strengthening my grasp on persistence in web applications.
